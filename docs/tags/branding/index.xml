      <description>Dappest is a blockchain startup whose creator I worked with at Guardiome. They brought me onboard to create their branding, business cards, and create other graphical elements for the web app&amp;rsquo;s interface.
Dappest is best described as &amp;ldquo;Yelp for DApps&amp;rdquo; in that it&amp;rsquo;s a community-driven ranking and commenting platform but focuses on DApps.
Branding The early stages of branding were very exploratory as the identity of the company was still being formed.</description>
