      <description>Pipeline When I was first hired at Buck in 2019, one of the things I expressed interest in and that they wanted was tools to make using Houdini easier.

I established a global HSITE and turned it into a git-based respository which allowed me to make changes which propagated across all the studios around the globe.

      <description>Having recently got a 3D printer, I became really interested in creating one virtually in Houdini. There are a few different approaches, just like there are in real life. What&amp;rsquo;s great is being able to break the constraints of technology and do any made-up method you want. I chose lasers because lasers are SWEET.
