      <description>Older ShadesClub work can be found here. Every so often ShadesClub upgrades its wares, packaging, and branding, and needs new visualizations of their products for their digital storefront.

      <description>Having recently got a 3D printer, I became really interested in creating one virtually in Houdini. There are a few different approaches, just like there are in real life. What&amp;rsquo;s great is being able to break the constraints of technology and do any made-up method you want. I chose lasers because lasers are SWEET.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;http://twistedsifter.com/2013/12/light-bending-cube-of-one-way-mirrors-numen-for-use/&#34;&gt;a project&lt;/a&gt; someone had done where they put 6 one-way mirrors together to form a internally-reflecting cube, lit with fluorescent tubes inside. I wanted to see if I could do it in 3D, so I did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
