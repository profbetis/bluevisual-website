Various layouts of various productsVarious layouts of various productsLens layer animationScene Setup Before this project, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to do a multiple-product rendering project in Houdini before, so I learned lots. The challenge was to have the same products in different layouts to have the client pick his favorite, sometimes with different rig parameters and different cameras.</description>

      <description>Having recently got a 3D printer, I became really interested in creating one virtually in Houdini. There are a few different approaches, just like there are in real life. What&amp;rsquo;s great is being able to break the constraints of technology and do any made-up method you want. I chose lasers because lasers are SWEET.
Custom Slicer The first thing I did is try to slice up a 3D model into lots of layers, as 3D printers do.</description>

      <title>Kubota Earth Anim</title>

      <description>Ambidextrous Productions came to me for rendering a realistic globe animation for a commercial spot they were working on. They were creating a spot for Kubota Tractors, which provide a wide range of farming vechicles across the globe. The animation was urgent, and important, but the project completed on-time and successfully.
Shaders Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface was created with NASA&amp;rsquo;s blue dot textures (diffuse, specular, bump). When the camera zooms down into the surface, I needed closer maps, so I grabbed some from Google Earth at different zoom levels and positioned them so they lined up.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine does freelance product design, and needed renders of his designs for his client&amp;rsquo;s pitch (QGS). He came to me to do a few animations for the project. Even though it was extremely short notice (not his fault), we completed the project successfully and on-time. QGS is a genetics sequencing company that intends to democratize expensive genome sequencing in the lab.
My client provided the model files which were exported from Solidworks, and told me what materials the different parts had, and how each device opened and operated.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first got my apartment, I wanted really neat furniture for it, so I got some. Two of the things I got were these Bungee chairs that have a very springy feeling to them. They were so cool that as soon as I returned home with them I went back and got another one that night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while now I&amp;rsquo;ve had an idea for this hexagonal three-story cabin fit for about two people with room for guests. Upstairs is the bedroom/study with a large glass roof (imagine watching rain under that!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I wanted to see if I could do it in 3D, so I did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
