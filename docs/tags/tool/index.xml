      <description>An example project that uses the output of the edgewalker.Algorithm The Edgewalker tool starts at a group of points, and walks along edges to neighboring points to create an edge group or polyline.
A progression of snapshots of the algorithm. A frame is skipped between each stage for demonstration purposes.A progression of snapshots of the algorithm. A frame is skipped between each stage for demonstration purposes.While the look can seem similar to the Find Shortest Path SOP or perhaps Edge Network, those nodes don&amp;rsquo;t avoid current edges and have many merges or splits.</description>

      <description>SHNOPs (visit the repo!) is an open-source toolset designed in and to use with SideFX&amp;rsquo;s Houdini.
It stands for Simple Houdini Number OPerators. Its purpose is to provide a simple and cohesive framework to manipulate and analyze datasets into meaningful and interesting geometric respresentations.
I was originally inspired to create this toolset when I had data of my own that I wanted to visualize and analyze myself instead of relying on another program that could do it differently or not offer the tools I wanted.</description>
