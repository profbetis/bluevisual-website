      <title>BUCK Houdini Pipeline</title>

      <description>Pipeline When I was first hired at Buck in 2019, one of the things I expressed interest in and that they wanted was tools to make using Houdini easier. Before I started my work, Buck had no Houdini pipeline. I established a global HSITE and turned it into a git-based respository which allowed me to make changes which propagated across all the studios around the globe.
I converted any the local &amp;lsquo;houdini.</description>

      <title>Cellular Automata Playground</title>

      <description>Overview Cellular Automata has always fascinated me, and as a teenager I even programmed some recreations of Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life. After getting into Houdini and seeing some beautiful rules or patterns, I wanted a way to play around with rules and create my own artworks.
In particular, I was inspired by the concept of multiple rules on a singular canvas. I had seen someone implement this concept poorly, and I wanted to do it better.</description>

      <description>An example project that uses the output of the edgewalker.Algorithm The Edgewalker tool starts at a group of points, and walks along edges to neighboring points to create an edge group or polyline.
A progression of snapshots of the algorithm. A frame is skipped between each stage for demonstration purposes.A progression of snapshots of the algorithm. A frame is skipped between each stage for demonstration purposes.While the look can seem similar to the Find Shortest Path SOP or perhaps Edge Network, those nodes don&amp;rsquo;t avoid current edges and have many merges or splits.</description>

      <title>SHNOPs Toolset</title>

      <description>SHNOPs (visit the repo!) is an open-source toolset designed in and to use with SideFX&amp;rsquo;s Houdini.
It stands for Simple Houdini Number OPerators. Its purpose is to provide a simple and cohesive framework to manipulate and analyze datasets into meaningful and interesting geometric respresentations.
I was originally inspired to create this toolset when I had data of my own that I wanted to visualize and analyze myself instead of relying on another program that could do it differently or not offer the tools I wanted.</description>
