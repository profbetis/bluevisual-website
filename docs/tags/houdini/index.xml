      <title>BUCK Houdini Pipeline</title>

      <description>Pipeline When I was first hired at Buck in 2019, one of the things I expressed interest in and that they wanted was tools to make using Houdini easier. Before I started my work, Buck had no Houdini pipeline. I established a global HSITE and turned it into a git-based respository which allowed me to make changes which propagated across all the studios around the globe.
I converted any the local &amp;lsquo;houdini.</description>

      <description>Buck was tasked with creating spots for AirBnB&amp;rsquo;s Aircover, an insurance program for their hosts. Rain System Similar to the Amazon Halo Spot, we needed rain for this moody animation. In fact, I brought over the same system and tweaked it for our needs and added some additional controls.
There were many iterations on the look and feel of the rain drops, their splashes, and their puddles. Knowing this is always the case, the tool was designed for ultimate flexibility in mind, so it was easy to adjust.</description>

      <description>Overview BUCK was hired by Meta to create graphics for their annual 2022 Connect conference. I was brought on early to help with 3D design and lookdev of certain effects for the project.
You can find BUCK&amp;rsquo;s project page for this here.
Lookdev Early on in lookdev, we were trying to create something unique and interesting that had life. We explored many concepts but ultimately landed on projected light across physical, grounded objects.</description>

      <description>When it first opened, Houdini.School&amp;rsquo;s founder Deborah reached out to me to have me make a class. I was very busy at the time for many months but eventually in 2022 I was able to set aside some time to create a small syllabus and a cohesive theme enough to create a course for.
Teaser for the courseProblem Space is an atypical course more about concepts and thinking strategies rather than focused on a particular tutorial for an effect.</description>

      <description>Overview For this project, I worked with Buck&amp;rsquo;s Amsterdam office to create a series of tantilizing spots to showcase their 10, 12, and 18-year whiskies.
I was brought on very early on the project to oversee the creation of the primary effect of the commercials. I had to make sure the simulated effect was efficient enough to work with in a reasonable fashion to be able to iterate on quickly, as well as be able to send to the render farm and get final render results in a reasonable time frame.</description>

      <description>In this project, I was tasked with doing some rain effects for the Amazon Halo commercial. Rain One of the asks was for a particular droplet splash that hits the product. It needed to be able to be timed precisely and generate physically accurate secondary droplets. Because I hate simulating things, I decided I would design a procedural system for this that was seamless with the background rain.</description>

      <description>Overview Buck was hired to do some mind-bendingly fun spots for Truly&amp;rsquo;s new flavors. I was brought on in the middle of production to handle the dynamics for certain shots.
Droplet Simulation In this shot, the droplets were needed to splash away from the can and be gone where the fruits had touched the can.
One of the difficulties in this ask was that the droplets on the can were already baked in as a static mesh.</description>

      <description>Snapchat needed a tranquil intro for their Snap Summit 2020 before the event aired. The animation actually lasted for 15 minutes and was very slowly evolving.
The ask was for something seemingly holographic a la James Turrell&amp;rsquo;s artwork. I created a system in Houdini that let me take a base shape and create a slew of faint distorted shells that covered the visual spectrum to build up an ethereal image.</description>

      <description>Overview Cellular Automata has always fascinated me, and as a teenager I even programmed some recreations of Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life. After getting into Houdini and seeing some beautiful rules or patterns, I wanted a way to play around with rules and create my own artworks.
In particular, I was inspired by the concept of multiple rules on a singular canvas. I had seen someone implement this concept poorly, and I wanted to do it better.</description>

      <description>Overview In this project, Microsoft asked us to explore creative, eye-catching, tactile, looping videos to promote their soon-to-be-released office suite that had been redesigned for mobile use.
I was tasked with some of the trickier effects that we had chosen to do, the main two being a balloon inflation and popping simulation, and a glass surface constructed from melting multi-colored glass beads.

      <description>As an introductory project for working with ARYSE, they wanted to create a bracelet using less material, and an interesting design that showcased their identity as a company. They are looking into experimental and generative design techniques for their products.
For this first project, they just wanted a bracelet for promotional material. This let me explore what the pipeline would be like with them and to start building some techniques and tools that would work well for future projects.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;SideTrip is a series of paintings focused on two characters: Azure, a boy and Alex, the God of Hiding who travel in a lonely universe of everything and nothing. The two characters explore various worlds shaped by emotion, idea, and philosophy.&amp;rdquo; — Project Director
It&amp;rsquo;s a project directed by my friend Yuya Takeda where he frequently gets 3D artists to contribute to scenes. For this scene we were asked to contribute intricate designs in the style of turkish mosaic lamps.</description>

The challenge was to have the same products in different layouts to have the client pick his favorite, sometimes with different rig parameters and different cameras.</description>

      <description>SHNOPs (visit the repo!) is an open-source toolset designed in and to use with SideFX&amp;rsquo;s Houdini.
It stands for Simple Houdini Number OPerators. Its purpose is to provide a simple and cohesive framework to manipulate and analyze datasets into meaningful and interesting geometric respresentations.
I was originally inspired to create this toolset when I had data of my own that I wanted to visualize and analyze myself instead of relying on another program that could do it differently or not offer the tools I wanted.</description>

      <description>This was a test I did of spilling paint on something. I originally planned for it to be distinct layers of colors on top of one another, but it naturally developed into the smoothly evolving change of one paint color to another.
Dynamics This was one of my first serious forrays into FLIP simulations, and I learned a lot about fluid meshing, reseeding, and FLIP sources. This amount of simulation was probably overkill looking back, as the fluid mesh was much denser than the surface tension allowed detail for, and I could have gotten a similar blobby look from subdividing during render for a lighter alembic file.</description>

      <description>Having recently got a 3D printer, I became really interested in creating one virtually in Houdini. There are a few different approaches, just like there are in real life. What&amp;rsquo;s great is being able to break the constraints of technology and do any made-up method you want. I chose lasers because lasers are SWEET.
Custom Slicer The first thing I did is try to slice up a 3D model into lots of layers, as 3D printers do.</description>

      <description>We Are Boats is a film by Zombot Pictures about love, death, and soul-searching. It was a part of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival.
I handled all the visual effects for the film. All shots were done at 4k.
Scenes included characters disappearing, camera tracking and 3D background substituion, dynamics and smoke simulation, layered matte painting and animation, compositing background elements, removing camera moire, replacing signage, phone screens, and television screens, blemish removal, and camera rig removal.</description>

      <description>This was one of my first forrays into Houdini and VEX, as the whole concept of open manipulatable data was so exciting (spoiler: it still is). I wanted to sort of &amp;ldquo;atomize&amp;rdquo; an object, and the reassemble it in a different order.
Orthographic Pathing I&amp;rsquo;m always attracted to cubes, so that was the first shape I decided to try it with, and it grew from there.</description>
