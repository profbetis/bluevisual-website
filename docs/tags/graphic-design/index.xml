      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this project, we needed to composite a screen onto a laptop that an actor was interacting with. Another artist was contracted to rotoscope and track the screens, while my job was to create an animatable replica of the Windows 8 interface as well as other apps like Outlook, Skype, and the default picture viewer. These fake apps had to be dynamic, as I would be adjusting and tweaking animations and content throughout the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
