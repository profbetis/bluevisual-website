      <title>A Prayer for the Damned</title>

      <description>While most of A Prayer for the Damned doesn&amp;rsquo;t have VFX, there were a few shots that needed a little more oomph.
Smoke and Debris Dynamics I roughly remade the chest and boot geometry and motion just enough to affect the smoke motion, but not for any rendering purposes. I attached the smoke&amp;rsquo;s fuel volume to the chest so that when kicked open, the emitter got dragged with it.</description>

      <description>We Are Boats is a film by Zombot Pictures about love, death, and soul-searching. It was a part of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival.
I handled all the visual effects for the film. All shots were done at 4k.
Scenes included characters disappearing, camera tracking and 3D background substituion, dynamics and smoke simulation, layered matte painting and animation, compositing background elements, removing camera moire, replacing signage, phone screens, and television screens, blemish removal, and camera rig removal.</description>

      <description>Valentine DayZ is a quirky horror movie about a zombie apocalypse.
I handled almost all of the visual effects for the film, the only exception being one of the shooting locations for a news broadcast offered an automated greenscreening process for one of the backdrop. I worked in After Effects for the motion tracking, rotoscoping, and compositing. All shots were done at 4k.
Dynamics Most of the smoke and fires in the film were simulated and rendered in Houdini and are supposed to represent portions of the city in ruins from the apocalypse.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Firebreathing Films asked me to do moderate VFX work for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4159698/&#34;&gt;The Fiancé&lt;/a&gt;, a horror movie. They needed rotoscoping, compositing, and general vfx work for their film.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this project, we needed to composite a screen onto a laptop that an actor was interacting with. Another artist was contracted to rotoscope and track the screens, while my job was to create an animatable replica of the Windows 8 interface as well as other apps like Outlook, Skype, and the default picture viewer. These fake apps had to be dynamic, as I would be adjusting and tweaking animations and content throughout the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
