      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a hobbyist photographer, I want to sell my prints. Unfortunately, buying each print in each different size would be very expensive and take up a lot of space. In addition, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really have a great place to put to stage great pictures of them. To solve these problems, I decided to model the canvases and environments, and render them to show them off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while now I&amp;rsquo;ve had an idea for this hexagonal three-story cabin fit for about two people with room for guests. Upstairs is the bedroom/study with a large glass roof (imagine watching rain under that!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
