      <description>Pipeline When I was first hired at Buck in 2019, one of the things I expressed interest in and that they wanted was tools to make using Houdini easier. Before I started my work, Buck had no Houdini pipeline. I established a global HSITE and turned it into a git-based respository which allowed me to make changes which propagated across all the studios around the globe.
I converted any the local &amp;lsquo;houdini.</description>

      <description>Buck was tasked with creating spots for AirBnB&amp;rsquo;s Aircover, an insurance program for their hosts. Rain System Similar to the Amazon Halo Spot, we needed rain for this moody animation. In fact, I brought over the same system and tweaked it for our needs and added some additional controls.
There were many iterations on the look and feel of the rain drops, their splashes, and their puddles. Knowing this is always the case, the tool was designed for ultimate flexibility in mind, so it was easy to adjust.</description>

      <description>Overview BUCK was hired by Meta to create graphics for their annual 2022 Connect conference. I was brought on early to help with 3D design and lookdev of certain effects for the project.
You can find BUCK&amp;rsquo;s project page for this here.
Lookdev Early on in lookdev, we were trying to create something unique and interesting that had life. We explored many concepts but ultimately landed on projected light across physical, grounded objects.</description>

      <description>When it first opened, Houdini.School&amp;rsquo;s founder Deborah reached out to me to have me make a class. I was very busy at the time for many months but eventually in 2022 I was able to set aside some time to create a small syllabus and a cohesive theme enough to create a course for.

      <description>Overview For this project, I worked with Buck&amp;rsquo;s Amsterdam office to create a series of tantilizing spots to showcase their 10, 12, and 18-year whiskies.
I was brought on very early on the project to oversee the creation of the primary effect of the commercials. I had to make sure the simulated effect was efficient enough to work with in a reasonable fashion to be able to iterate on quickly, as well as be able to send to the render farm and get final render results in a reasonable time frame.</description>

I worked closely with the lead on this project to provide all the volumetric and particle effects for the scene.

      <description>In this project, I was tasked with doing some rain effects for the Amazon Halo commercial. Rain One of the asks was for a particular droplet splash that hits the product. It needed to be able to be timed precisely and generate physically accurate secondary droplets. Because I hate simulating things, I decided I would design a procedural system for this that was seamless with the background rain.</description>

Droplet Simulation In this shot, the droplets were needed to splash away from the can and be gone where the fruits had touched the can.

      <description>Snapchat needed a tranquil intro for their Snap Summit 2020 before the event aired. The animation actually lasted for 15 minutes and was very slowly evolving.
The ask was for something seemingly holographic a la James Turrell&amp;rsquo;s artwork. I created a system in Houdini that let me take a base shape and create a slew of faint distorted shells that covered the visual spectrum to build up an ethereal image.</description>

      <description>Overview Cellular Automata has always fascinated me, and as a teenager I even programmed some recreations of Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life. After getting into Houdini and seeing some beautiful rules or patterns, I wanted a way to play around with rules and create my own artworks.
In particular, I was inspired by the concept of multiple rules on a singular canvas. I had seen someone implement this concept poorly, and I wanted to do it better.</description>

      <description>Overview In this project, Microsoft asked us to explore creative, eye-catching, tactile, looping videos to promote their soon-to-be-released office suite that had been redesigned for mobile use.
I was tasked with some of the trickier effects that we had chosen to do, the main two being a balloon inflation and popping simulation, and a glass surface constructed from melting multi-colored glass beads.

For this first project, they just wanted a bracelet for promotional material. This let me explore what the pipeline would be like with them and to start building some techniques and tools that would work well for future projects.</description>

      <description>SHNOPs (visit the repo!) is an open-source toolset designed in and to use with SideFX&amp;rsquo;s Houdini.
It stands for Simple Houdini Number OPerators. Its purpose is to provide a simple and cohesive framework to manipulate and analyze datasets into meaningful and interesting geometric respresentations.
I was originally inspired to create this toolset when I had data of my own that I wanted to visualize and analyze myself instead of relying on another program that could do it differently or not offer the tools I wanted.</description>

Dappest is best described as &amp;ldquo;Yelp for DApps&amp;rdquo; in that it&amp;rsquo;s a community-driven ranking and commenting platform but focuses on DApps.
Branding The early stages of branding were very exploratory as the identity of the company was still being formed.</description>

      <description>This was a test I did of spilling paint on something. I originally planned for it to be distinct layers of colors on top of one another, but it naturally developed into the smoothly evolving change of one paint color to another.
Dynamics This was one of my first serious forrays into FLIP simulations, and I learned a lot about fluid meshing, reseeding, and FLIP sources. This amount of simulation was probably overkill looking back, as the fluid mesh was much denser than the surface tension allowed detail for, and I could have gotten a similar blobby look from subdividing during render for a lighter alembic file.</description>

      <description>Having recently got a 3D printer, I became really interested in creating one virtually in Houdini. There are a few different approaches, just like there are in real life. What&amp;rsquo;s great is being able to break the constraints of technology and do any made-up method you want. I chose lasers because lasers are SWEET.
Custom Slicer The first thing I did is try to slice up a 3D model into lots of layers, as 3D printers do.</description>

I took an interest to it and created it in various 2D forms until I wanted to try doing it in 3D.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think most artists experiment with minimalism at least once in their careers. I know I have on multiple occasions. In this exercise, I wanted to minimize personality and human facial recognition.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in mathematics, which led to an early interest in fractals, which are mathematical self-similar shapes and formulas. A well-known one is the Mandelbrot fractal. A key characteristic of fractals is that if you look at a smaller part of the whole, you will see the same same structures at completely different scales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
