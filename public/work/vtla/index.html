  Vape Traze Logo Animation
</div>

<div class="project-content">
  <p>Vape Traze wanted a logo animation for standalone use and also to put into other various videos showcasing their product.</p>

<p>Initially the overall feel and art-style was open and undefined, but after trying a few different things, we decided on a techy/glowing theme that matched the internals of a vaporizer.</p>

<p>Luckily in one of my personal projects, I made a procedural circuit generator, which sped up a lot of the asset creation time. I was able to randomize and generate circuits over and over with ease until I got just the one I wanted.</p>

<p>The animation of the E provides a nice contrasting color with the rest of the scene, and also communicates to the audience what the product market is.</p>
