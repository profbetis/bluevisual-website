quote = "Kevin really \"steps ups\" a project. We first hired Kevin on a large scale Intel Project. Once we saw his creative and technical talents paired with the great creative suggestions that he made, he was put in charge of two (very well  received) large scale projects for a Bell Helicopter reveal. He would be a huge asset to any project."
