# Overview
In this project, Microsoft asked us to explore creative, eye-catching, tactile, looping videos to promote their soon-to-be-released office suite that had been redesigned for mobile use.

I was tasked with some of the trickier effects that we had chosen to do, the main two being a balloon inflation and popping simulation, and a glass surface constructed from melting multi-colored glass beads.

# Design Exploration
The project also had a long design phase that I was a part of and then eventually continued into the production phase for. These are some of my designs and renders from that.
