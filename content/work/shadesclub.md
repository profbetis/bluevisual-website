[ShadesClub](http://www.shadesclub.com/) needed an array of new promotional materials for their rebranding. Before, all their images were actual photographs but they wanted a fully 3D version so that anything could be done and animations would be possible.

The initial setup took a while before I had anything useful. The box and inner case needed to be modeled and rigged for animation, as well as creating other promotional items such as the koozie and microfiber bag.
