[ShadesClub](http://www.shadesclub.com/) needed an array of new promotional materials for their 2016 rebranding. Before, all their images were actual photographs but they wanted fully 3D versions so that any scenes and animations would be possible.

The initial setup took a while before I had anything useful. The box and inner case needed to be modeled and rigged for animation, as well as creating other promotional items such as the koozie and microfiber bag. After all of the components were done, animating them together should be fairly simple.
