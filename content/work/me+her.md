The short film Me + Her is a love story about two cardboard characters who grow up together but are separated suddenly by the death of one of them. The other character, through a series of events, unexpected "reunites" with her.

The film is a live-action movie that used puppets and a small-scale set (the cardboard houses were about 4 feet high). They only had about 12 houses because of the limited space they had to work in and the incredible work it takes to make each house. The problem was that for the final end shot they wanted a picture of the whole implied town that the story takes place in. I was hired to create their town in 3D and match a real camera move for the final scene in the movie. The city was massive and was very taxing on my machine to edit and render.
