Firebreathing Films asked me to do moderate VFX work for [The Fiancé](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4159698/), a horror movie.

{{< video 1 >}}

A majority of the shots were placing glowing eyes on various characters via motion tracking.

Other times I rotoscoped cars out of backgrounds and reflections as to not be distracting, or placed a few elements into the scenes.

One of the more creative and fun scenes to do was adding a projected image into a certain scene.
{{< image 1 "Closeup of a final composted frame" >}}

This was my process:
1. Rotoscope the foreground to create an alpha matte
2. Project the screen onto the background
3. Cast shadows by subtracting an offset version of the foreground alpha channel from the backdrop.
4. Project an offset and distorted image onto the characters
5. Place the character projections back on using the foreground's alpha matte
