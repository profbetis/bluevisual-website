Firebreathing Films asked me to do moderate VFX work for [The Fiancé](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4159698/), a horror movie. They needed rotoscoping, compositing, and general vfx work for their film.<!--more-->

# Projector Scene
One of the more creative problem-solving and fun scenes to do was adding a projected image into a certain scene.

1. Rotoscope the foreground to create an alpha matte
2. Project the screen onto the background
3. Cast shadows by subtracting an offset version of the foreground alpha channel from the backdrop.
4. Project an offset and distorted image onto the characters
5. Place the character projections back on using the foreground's alpha matte

# Iris Enhancements
A majority of the shots were placing glowing eyes on various characters via motion tracking.

# General Compositing
Other times I rotoscoped cars out of backgrounds and reflections as to not be distracting, or placed a few elements into the scenes.
