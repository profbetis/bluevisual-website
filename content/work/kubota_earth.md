Ambidextrous Productions came to me for rendering a realistic globe animation for a commercial spot they were working on. The change was last-minute and urgent, and extremely pressed for time, but the project completed successfully.

Ambidextrous was creating a spot for Kubota Tractors, which provide a wide range of farming vechicles across the globe.
