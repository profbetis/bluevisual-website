[Guardiome](http://www.guardiome.com) is a bioinformatics startup from San Diego. They provide completely privitized genomic analysis from inside your home. They came to me looking for a complete branding package from the ground up, including their website and all the necessary visuals to fill it out.<!--more-->

An important part project of this was the product renders. They provided me with a 3D mesh exported from Solidworks of their product, which I cleaned up, created materials, and then built environments for.
