[Guardiome](http://www.guardiome.com) is a bioinformatics startup from San Diego. They provide completely privitized genomic analysis from inside your home. They came to me looking for a complete branding package from the ground up, including their website and all the necessary visuals to fill it out.<!--more-->

# Product Renders

An important part project of this was the product renders. They provided me with a 3D mesh exported from Solidworks of their product, which I cleaned up, created materials, and then built environments for.

# Graphics

Some of the graphics were hero shots, while others were more background elements and banners for the site. These custom graphics were also used in the various pitch decks we put together to show investors.

# Website

The website was built in Squarespace with lots of custom CSS to really dial in the elegant look the client wanted to convey. This proved to be fairly challenging, as with Squarespace, you're unable to change how the HTML is generated, so almost everything you need to do has to be purely a CSS modification.

# Branding

The branding included colors, two font faces for all documents, and a few different logo variations for use in different contexts.
