[Guardiome](http://www.guardiome.com) is a genomics company that gives people easy access to their genome. I worked with them to design branding, the website and its graphics, product renders, and much more.<!--more--> I am now the Chief Creative Officer at Guardiome.

# Product Renders

An important part project of this was the product renders. They provided me with a 3D mesh exported from Solidworks of their product, which I cleaned up, created materials, and then built environments for.

# Graphics

Some of the graphics were hero shots, while others were more background elements and banners for the site. These custom graphics were also used in the various pitch decks we put together for presentations.

# Website

The website was built in Squarespace with lots of custom CSS to really dial in the elegant look we wanted to convey. This proved to be fairly challenging, as with Squarespace, you're unable to change how the HTML is generated, so almost everything you need to do has to be purely a CSS modification.

# Branding

The branding included colors, font faces, printed documents, and a few different logo variations for use in different contexts.
