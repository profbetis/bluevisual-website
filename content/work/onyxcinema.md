## Revisited April 2015

[Onyx Cinema](http://www.onyxcinema.com/) is an incredible cinematography company. After years of skill and network growth, they decided it was time to re-brand and get a new website. They hired a colleague of mine to design the logo, and she directed them to me for the animation aspect of it.

When I saw the logo, I immediately thought of gyroscopic rings that eventually locked into place. The client also wanted the rings to lock into place at the end like lens elements (as cameras are an integral part of their workflow). The back plate is also a custom dark onyx material that strengthens the feeling of quality and solidarity.

About a year an a half after the original contract, the client came back needing a 4k version for his talk at the NAB Show about film-making. There were some things that I had wanted to change since the original version, like the onyx stone backdrop, the lighting, and adding some motion blur (which my rendering program didn't provide at the time of the first version). These changes really upgraded the overall look and prepared it for 4k viewing.
