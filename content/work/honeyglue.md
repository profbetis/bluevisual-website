[Zombot Pictures](http://zombotpictures.com) hired me for their film Honeyglue for VFX/compositing and also for 2D animation of a storybook which I worked with illustrations from another artist.

For the 3D I used Luxology's Modo 701. It was my first project where I had built my own character, discovering the complexities, frustrations, and satisfaction of building and rigging a character from scratch. While its role was not huge, realism was a top priority. I studied motions and visuals of honeybees from videos across the web (and when I encountered them in real life)

VFX was only half the project. I was also contracted to do storybook animations for certain narrative portions of the film. I was provided with Photoshop assets from an illustrator who drew them. My job was to take the layers/characters and animate them. I decided to go beyond the 2D realm of a book and try a sort of 3D parallaxing style. The clients enjoyed it so I went through with it.
