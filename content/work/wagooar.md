[WagooAR](http://www.wagooar.com/) is an emerging company that creates efficient, spatially-aware augmented reality technology. To propose their concepts  to potential investors, they needed a website and a video showcasing their technology and it's applications.

The project required me to create animations and composite graphics onto live footage for their crowdfunding pitch video as well as the design, construction, and maintenance of [their website](http://www.wagooar.com/).

# Crowd-funding Video
One of the main aspects of the project was to take live footage of various hypothetical scenarios and overlay a mockup of glasses and the UI as if the viewer was using the product.

The scenes required both 2D motion tracking and 3D camera tracking. After the shots are tracked, the UI for the scene is designed, animated, and composited into the scene. And of course, the look wouldn't be complete without the semblance of the glasses that the UI would be seen through.

## Compositing
Mockups of the UI were designed and composited into the scene to demonstrate potential applications for the technology.

## Animations
In addition to compositing UI mockups, there are also scenes that are entirely 3D animation to explain the technology and its systems.

For the turntables, the antennas and their components are rendered in 3D on top of a pair of glasses. Glasses models were found online and modified and improved for our uses.

This character model was purchased online and then cleaned up and re-textured at a higher resolution and with different facial features.

# Website
A website was also needed to accompany the video and to give the company a more solid presence. I worked closely with the client to visualize his ideas for the website, making sure the design was responsive on many different devices. We chose Squarespace due to its ease of use to create and maintain. No themes really gave us the style, the layout, or the building blocks that we needed in the design, so there are lots of hand-crafted elements and CSS.
