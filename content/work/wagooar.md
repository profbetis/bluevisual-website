[WagooAR](http://www.wagooar.com/) is an emerging company that creates efficient, spatially-aware augmented reality technology. To propose their concepts  to potential investors, they needed a website and a video showcasing their technology and it's applications.<!--more-->

The project required me to create and augment material for their crowdfunding pitch video as well as the design, creation, and maintenance of [their website](http://www.wagooar.com/).

## Crowd-funding Video

One of the main aspects of the project was to take live footage of various hypothetical scenarios and overlay a mockup of glasses and the UI as if the viewer was using the product.

The scenes required both 2D motion tracking and 3D camera tracking. After the shots are tracked, the UI for the scene is designed, animated, and composited into the scene. And of course, the look wouldn't be complete without the semblance of the glasses that the UI would be seen through.

In addition to compositing UI mockups, there are also scenes that are entirely 3D animation to explain the technology and its systems.

The antennas and their components are rendered in 3D on top of a pair of glasses. Glasses models were found online and modified and improved for our uses.

## Website

A website was also needed to accompany the video and to give the company a more solid presence. I worked closely with the client to visualize his ideas for the website, making sure the design was responsive on many different devices.

We chose Squarespace due to its ease of use to create and maintain. No themes really gave us the style, the layout, or the elements that we needed in our design, so there are many custom HTML elements and lots of custom CSS.
