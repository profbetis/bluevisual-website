This project was the first one that I worked on that was used as a room-sized projection! I rendered at 8000x1080 for a super wide-angle camera. In fact, it was so wide angle that I had to use a special cylindrical projection camera to grab the 270Â° field of view.

The final product was used in the live unveiling of a new helicopter from [Bell Helicopter](http://www.bellhelicopter.com/). I wasn't hired by Bell directly, I worked with [Steam](http://www.steamshow.com/), a Santa Monica based visual production studio.

The 3D terrains here were purchased and then tweaked specifically for our needs. I also made custom water and atmosphere shaders to really bring out the depth and nature of the scenes. The city scene was a bit different. I ended up using motionless particles to create a huge spawling array of buildings with various properties. I made custom window textures that were warped just subtly enough to give that warped feel that skyscrapers have.
