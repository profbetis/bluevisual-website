This project was for the live unveiling of a new helicopter from [Bell Helicopter](http://www.bellhelicopter.com/). I wasn't hired by Bell directly, I worked with [Steam](http://www.steamshow.com/), a Santa Monica based visual production studio.

This project was the first one that I worked on that was used as a room-sized projection! I rendered at 8000x1080 for a super wide-angle camera. In fact, it was so wide angle that I had to use a special cylindrical projection camera to grab the 270Â° field of view.

## Alpine Scene
The 3D terrains here were purchased and then tweaked specifically for our needs. I also made custom water and atmosphere shaders to really bring out the depth and nature of the scenes.

## Canyon Scene
The canyon's textures are actually heavily modified, as the ones that came with the model were green and luscious, so I adjusted them to have that classic red-rock look that many deserts and canyons have.

## City Scene
 The city scene was a bit different. I ended up using motionless particles to create a huge spawling array of buildings with various properties. The hero buildings were purchased and places in important parts of the scene and were given special attention to detail.

 I also created custom window textures including normal maps that make the surface warped just subtly enough to give that subtle rippled look that skyscraper windows have.
