When Apple needed a keynote to release their new M1 chip, they had Buck create many animations to show the precise, elegant, and powerful engineering behind their new chip and products using it. Some shots involved dozens or hundreds of components to be orchestrated, which was best done using Houdini.

Some of the requirements were behind the scenes, like procedurally assigning chip models to their respective places on the motherboard for accurate representation of the hardware, and others were a bit more front-and-center, like these this shot where the chips snap into the motherboard, or the bit where the chip warps out of frame leaving behind a colorful warp tunnel.
