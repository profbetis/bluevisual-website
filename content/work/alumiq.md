[Alumiq](http://alumiq.com/) *(pronounced 'uh-loo-mik')* is a Los Angeles, Orange County and San Francisco wedding photography and cinematography studio that films and edits on the same day, highlighting the day's events in a spectacular composition. Their work beautifully captures the high spirits and love the couples and families at the ceremonies have.<!--more-->

I was contacted after [a colleague of mine](http://www.thejoylin.com/) designed their new logo for a rebranding, and they needed it animated to show as an introduction for their videos.

Their name means 'playing with light', so to capture that I created playfully reflective and translucent glass, which follows and strengthens their branding identity.
