[Alumiq](http://alumiq.com/) is a wedding videography studio that film and edit on the same day, highlighting the day's events in a spectacular composition. Their work very well captures the high spirits and love the couples and families at the ceremonies have.

I was contacted after [a colleague of mine](http://www.thejoylin.com/) designed their new logo for a rebranding, and they needed it animated to show at the beginning of their videos.

Their name means 'playing with light', so to capture that, I created playfully reflective and translucent glass, which strengthens and reaffirms their branding identity.
