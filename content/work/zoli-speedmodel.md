A colleague of mine worked briefly at [Zoli](http://zoli-inc.com/) as a product designer. He needed some high-res production renders of a product but they had no 3D files to work with, only a low-res photograph. We didn't have much time, so I needed to deliver something quickly and high quality.

The project gave me some great experience on efficient product modeling and rendering in a real-world scenario.
