A colleague of mine worked briefly at [Zoli](http://zoli-inc.com/) as a product designer. He needed some high-res production renders of a product but they had no 3D files to work with, only a medium-size photograph. We didn't have much time, so I needed to deliver something quickly and at high quality.

## 4 total working hours
{{< image 1 "Final Render A" >}}
{{< image 2 "Render A's solid wireframe" >}}
{{< image 3 "Final Render B" >}}
{{< image 4 "Render B's wireframe" >}}
{{< image 5 "Render B's clay wireframe" >}}

The project gave me some good experience on quick product modeling and rendering in a real-world scenario.
