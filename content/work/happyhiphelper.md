The Happy Hip Helper is a simple tool for assisting physical therapy patients with strengthening and exercising their hip muscles and regaining proper mobility.<!--more-->

For this project there needed to be a demonstrative figure in various poses with and without the product showing different exercises. These renders are then used on a poster that comes with the product.

3DS Max is used to pose the figures and model the props and product, using Octane Render for what it does best â€” rendering.
