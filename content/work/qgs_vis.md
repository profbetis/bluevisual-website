A friend of mine does freelance product design, and needed renders for his client's pitch using his designs. He came to me to do a few animations for the project. Even though it was extremely short notice, we completed the project successfully.

QGS is a genetics sequencing company that intends to democratize expensive genome sequencing in the lab.
