This project required a few different things. Compositing screens (LOTS OF THEM), the design and animation of them, and a intro sequence for the beginning of the show.<!--more-->

Me and the client discussed different ways to do things, and I was given a lot of creative freedom, which was really nice. I really felt in my element too because I love computers and they're an important part of my life. My interest in this allowed to have insightful artistic direction and believeable content.

# Compositing & VFX
Compositing screens required lots of tedius rotoscoping and motion tracking. The footage had tracking markers placed onto the screens to assist with this, which it did, but it also made some scenes more difficult because of removing them from the screen. A matte object would have been simpler, but due to the reflective nature of the screens, some tracking markers were particularly difficult.

All the screens needed to be designed and animated as well, with the more difficult ones being fake software being run and used by characters, their mouse movements, and keystrokes.

# Intro Sequence
I also was hired to make the show's intro sequence. This was accomplished with an XBox Kinect hooked up to a DSLR with synchronized recording. I was then able to import the footage to a program that let me manipulate the 3D data in space and make my own camera moves. After this I exported the new rendered footage into Adobe After Effects to add more 3D elements like layers of code and particles, along with some sweet processing like motion blur and glows.
