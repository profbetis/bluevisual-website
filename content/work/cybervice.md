This is the first project I was hired to do visual effects and compositing all on my own. I designed interfaces, animated them, and composited them into the scene using through a combination of various methods including rotoscoping and color keying.

Me and the client discussed different ways to do things, and I was given a lot of creative freedom, which was really nice. I really felt in my element too because I love computers and they're an important part of my life. My interest in this allowed to have insightful artistic direction and believeable content.

I also was hired to make the show's intro sequence. This was accomplished with an XBox Kinect hooked up to a DSLR with synchronized recording. I was then able to import the footage to a program that let me manipulate the 3D data in space and make my own camera moves. After this I exported the new rendered footage into Adobe After Effects to add more 3D elements like layers of code and particles, along with some sweet processing like motion blur and glows.
