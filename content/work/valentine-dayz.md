[Valentine DayZ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5950092/) is a quirky horror movie about a zombie apocalypse.

{{< video 1 >}}

I handled most the visual effects for the film, the only exception being one of the shooting locations offered an automated greenscreening process for one of the scenes. I worked in After Effects for the motion tracking, rotoscoping, and compositing. All shots were done at 4k.

# Compositing
Vein-work was keyframed in a mesh-warp effect in After Effects. It was grueling and I hope I never have to do it again.

# Dynamics
Most of the smoke and fires in the film were simulated and rendered in Houdini. The fires out of focus were done procedurally in After Effects for quick interactive tweaking.
