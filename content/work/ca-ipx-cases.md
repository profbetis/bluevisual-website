Phone case renders for [Caudabe's iPhone X Collection](https://www.caudabe.com/collections/iphone-x-accessories).

[Caudabe](https://www.caudabe.com/) is a phone case manufacturing company which specializes in sleek, precision products that offer beauty and protection. I work with them to visualize their products for online presentation.<!--more-->

For this project, they had four new cases for their 'iPhone X Collection'. The client needed near-final products before the announcement of the iPhone X. This presented a challenge in that all looks and styles of the new phone were educated guesses and speculation.

For most of the shots, the camera angle and object layout is decided by the client and then fine-tuned later on in the project. Some shots and image concepts are less solidified and require artistic direction, such as the family shot above.

# Renders


## Lucid
The Lucid is their crystal clear transparent case. This case can be difficult to work with due to the highly glossy reflective and refractive nature of the material. Extra attention must be paid to the intensity and shape of the highlights.

## Veil XT
The Veil XT is a texturized case that's usually opaque, but the Frost variation introduces some transluscency.

## Synthesis
The Synthesis has a transluscent rough back. Here I implemented subsurface scattering to accurately capture the effect as the case tapers towards the rear camera element.
