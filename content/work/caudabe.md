[Caudabe](https://www.caudabe.com/) is a phone case manufacturing company which specializes in sleek, precision products that offer beauty and protection. I work with them to visualize their products for online presentation.<!--more-->

Before working with me, they used photography for all their product shots. They had a great photographer doing this work, but photography by nature lacks the flexibility and perfection of a purely virtual approach.

# Rendering
The primary outcome of my work is renders that show different angles and variations of each product for use on their online store. Due to the high-quality engineering they provide in their products, my product also needs to match that standard when delivering.

## Clarity
### iPhone 7
The [Clarity](https://www.caudabe.com/) case is a transparent case with a metallic ink pattern on the outside. This was different from the other cases because of the need for UV maps, which CAD files don't provide.

# Animation
Caudabe provides a tool to aid in the removal of their cases, since some fit so snugly that they're difficult to remove by hand.

While I originally attempted to do the animation in 3DS Max, the program was not faring well, and I decided to try to use Houdini for the first time in production. Houdini ended up being an extremely fun, powerful, and customizable tool for the job. From Houdini I exported the animation as an alembic file to render in Octane's standalone application.
