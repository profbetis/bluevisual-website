Dappest is a blockchain startup whose creator I worked with at [Guardiome](http://bluevisual.tv/work/guardiome/). They brought me onboard to create their branding, business cards, and create other graphical elements for the web app's interface.

Dappest is best described as "Yelp for DApps" in that it's a community-driven ranking and commenting platform but focuses on DApps.

# Branding
The early stages of branding were very exploratory as the identity of the company was still being formed. The first idea was that of an award necklace in the shape of a "D" for Dappest, but quickly converged on a crown which we thought looked approachable and meaningful.

After the initial concepting was locked down, I worked with another designer on the project in Figma (an online collaborative vector design program) to bounce ideas off each other and share elements in a common idea playground. When we finally reached a design we thought was modern, unique, and friendly, I took the design back into my own hands and finished the final file and colors in Affinity Designer.

# Graphics
When the branding was finished, it was ready to be used to create some graphics.

# Business Cards
I was also tasked with designing business cards for the team. Again here there wasn't too much preconception beforehand, so I made a variety of designs ranging from flashy to more conservative. They ended up going with a more conservative design sadly.
