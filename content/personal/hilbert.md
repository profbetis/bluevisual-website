The [Hilbert Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) is a space-filling fractal curve. It has many computer science applications and I've run across its algorithm in the programs I use before.<!--more-->

I took an interest to it and created it in various 2D forms until I wanted to try using one of the images as a displacement map. The result was something very similar to the result shown here, but being restricted to the false nature of render-time effects, I recreated the object in 3D, using my knowledge of the fractal and use its structure to facilitate the creation of the full model.
