I've always been interested in mathematics, which led to an early interest in fractals, which are mathematical self-similar shapes and formulas. A well-known one is the Mandelbrot fractal. A key characteristic of fractals is that if you look at a smaller part of the whole, you will see the same same structures at completely different scales.

I wanted to see what it would be like to design my own, so I did. It's a simple rule: for every cube, there is another cube half the size on each face. Theoretically this would generate an infinite number of smaller and smaller cubes, so for practical purposes, you iterate the system only a certain number of times. For most of these images, there are 7 iterations.
