I've always been interested in mathematics, which led to an early interest in fractals, which are mathematical self-similar shapes and formulas. A well-known one is the Mandelbrot fractal. A key characteristic of fractals is that if you look at a smaller part of the whole, you will see the same same structures on vastly different scales.
