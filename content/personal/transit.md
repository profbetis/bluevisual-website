Transit (as it's currently called) is a project that's been conceptual for a few years now but is finally coming to fruition now that VR is an available medium (and a perfect one at that!). It's a project about experiencing beautiful places and things.

You are in a cabin gliding along rails through beautiful environments and places. There are hardly any controls, only some gaze-activated menus inside your cabin. This is to let the player not worry about navigating environments, getting stuck somewhere, or needing to interact with anything in the real world.

There will be playlist functionality where you can load up a few different environments in sequence and they will load fairly seamlessly. There will also be looping environments where there is no entrance or exit, only a continuous circuit that you can ride forever. There will also be procedural tracks that go on forever and self-generate, giving you an infinite experience.

There is no objective to this game besides relaxing and enjoying the worlds you're in, escaping to great places you could never go in real life.
