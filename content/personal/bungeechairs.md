When I first got my apartment, I wanted really neat furniture for it, so I got some. Two of the things I got were these Bungee chairs that have a very springy feeling to them. They were so cool that as soon as I returned home with them I went back and got another one that night.<!--more-->

# Details
What really helped me nail down the look was having them here to look at all the details and be familiar with how they're constructed. Designing the actual seated areas for both was the most challenging, as they both are constructed from fabric in intricate patterns.

# Assets
Part of why I did this is so that I could sell them on 3D modeling markets for architectural visualizers to use when they're making homes and need to select nice furnishings to display in their designs. Because of that, I made sure to handle UVs, textures, and exports as cleanly as possible, so that people using the model had no trouble customizing and using the products.
