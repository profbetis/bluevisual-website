Being a hobbyist photographer, I want to sell my prints. Unfortunately, buying each print in each different size would be very expensive and take up a lot of space. In addition, I wouldn't really have a great place to put to stage great pictures of them. To solve these problems, I decided to model the canvases and environments, and render them to show them off.<!--more-->

You can find the prints on [Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/profbetis/m.html) and [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/KevinWeberCanvases).

# Canvas Renders

I modeled the apartment after my own that I lived in during my life in Detroit. It gave me great practice building a space that I could match with my own expectations of how materials looked and how lighting entered and bounced in rooms.

Placing each size canvas in an appropriate setting was important so that the buyer can get an accurate sense of scale from its surroundings and can help visualize where they might want to put the canvas.

# Overview Renders

These renders show the buyer the details of things that come with the canvas, so they can see how they might be mounting the canvases.
