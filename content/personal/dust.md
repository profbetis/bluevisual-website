I've always loved the concept of entropy, decay, chaos, destruction... but not in an evil or sinister way, in a beautiful and curious way. When you break something down, you can study its parts; the system. When something is destroyed, you see how it was created.

This project is primarily an experiment with slow motion physics simulations of destruction.
