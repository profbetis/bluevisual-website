Inspired by a project someone had done where they put 6 one-way mirrors together to form a internally-reflecting cube, lit with fluorescent tubes inside. I wanted to see if I could do it in 3D, so I did. One of the things that I noticed about the real project was that the imperfections and fluctuations in the mirrors/glass made the infinite hallways seem to warp more and more as it went "deeper" into the meta reflection. I added these imperfections to my own creation and they brought it to a new level of believability.
