For a while now I've had an idea for this hexagonal three-story cabin fit for about two people with room for guests. Upstairs is the bedroom/study with a large glass roof (imagine watching rain under that!).

When designing, I do try very much to think through the constraints of the real world, structurally and also logistically. A large glass roof can be hard to clean, and in the winter may be difficult to support any large amounts of snow that stay on top (as well as obstructing view). Maybe during the day you would want to close the light off from the roof, but can't. This helps me design better things for the house.

The project is a work in progress, so there aren't very many furnishings or final details filled out yet.

The second floor is the kitchen and dining room. It currently remains void of layout and furnishings.

## Ground Floor
The ground floor will be a general living room and study area with a smaller bathroom. It hasn't been laid out or furnished yet either.

## Old Designs
The cabin has been re-designed several times. Never in a completely new way, as the same three floors are always there, and the rotationally symmetric staircases remain, but the plans do shift from one generation to the next.Here are some older designs from much earlier in the project.
